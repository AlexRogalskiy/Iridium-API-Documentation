                <p>In a nutshell, an Iridium plugin is a Node.js program running on it's own separate process. You know
                    what
                    that
                    means ðŸ¤“, you can almost do anything! </p>
                <p>To help you get started, here's a complete step-by-step guide to build a plugin. We are going to
                    build a
                    cool web
                    dashboard that shows the progress of our lists.</p>
                <blockquote> This guide assumes you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 10 installed. If
                    you
                    haven't,
                    head over to Node.js website and download Node.js 10.</blockquote>

                <div class="title-container">
                    <h4 id="getting-started">Setting Up The Plugin </h4>
                    <small class="go-to-top-button"><a href="#top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up"></i></a></small>
                </div>
                <p>Let's start by setting up our plugin, create a file named <code>package.json</code> with the
                    following contents and save it under a dedicated directory, say, <code>iridium-dashboard</code>
                </p>
                <pre><code>{
    "name": "idirium-dashboard",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "description": "my first iridium plugin",
    "dependencies": {}
}</code></pre>
                <p>This will enable allow us to use <code>npm</code> to install some packages we need, for details
                    regarding <code>package.json</code>, see <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json">npm's
                        documentation</a>. Let's also add in the required <b>Iridium Plugin Manifest</b> as well, create
                    another file in the same
                    directory named <code>iridium.json</code>, we will go through it in detail later.</p>
                <blockquote class="important">Every plugin must have a valid<code>iridium.json</code> for it to be
                    recognized by Iridium
                </blockquote>
                <p>Let's put the following content into <code>iridium.json</code></p>
                <pre><code>{
    "id": "----REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN ID----",
    "name": "Cool Dashboard",
    "description": "A cool dashboard",
    "author": "Michael Lu",
    "image": "icon.png",
    "main": "index.js",
}</code></pre>
                <p>Then, we need to generate a unique ID for our plugin. You can use any <a
                        href="https://www.uuidgenerator.net/">online UUID generator</a> to generate one. After you
                    generate one, paste the ID you generated into <code>----RPLEACE WITH YOUR OWN ID----</code> and
                    save the file.</p>
                <p>So what is in <code>iridium.json</code>? It is the
                    basic config data that identifies your Node.js program to Iridium as a plugin. This way you can keep
                    your <code>package.json</code> separate, <code>package.json</code> file is not required for Iridium
                    to run y All fields are required. Several important things
                    to note for the manifest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>id</b> must be unuqie throughout all plugins in Iridium. Any UUID generator should give you
                        an unique UUID in the <b>world</b>. <blockquote>If plugins with duplicated IDs are found,
                            Iridium
                            will
                            refuse to load all of them and log them in <code>log.txt</code> file.</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>main</b> must speficies a proper javascript file. In this case, it's the file
                        <code>index.js</code> under the top level directory of your plugin. Feel free to change it to
                        match your own folder structure.</li>
                    <li><b>image</b> must speficies a valid icon for your plugin, this will be displayed in Iridium's
                        plugin page.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the icon, you can download any image and save it in
                    <code>iridium-dashboard</code> folder as <code>icon.png</code>. For best results, use a high definition square png file.</p>
